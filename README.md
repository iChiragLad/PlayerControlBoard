# PlayerControlBoard
PlayerControlBoard as an archetype of large extendable application gives an understanding of how large extendable applications are developed.
An IDE from Microsoft aka Visaul Studio fits as a perfect example of an Extendable application.
It allows 3rd party developers to write their plugins which can then be pluged into VS and work upon seemlesly.
PlayerControlBoard sterotypes this in a much smaller scale just to get the basic understanding of how extendalble applications are developed.
